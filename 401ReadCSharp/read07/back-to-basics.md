# What is an Interface?


## What problem does the interface solve?

### **The basic problem an interface is trying to solve is to separate how we use something from how it is implemented.**

### ***Interfaces are trying to solve a very specific problem by allowing us to interact with objects based on what they do, not how they do it.***


## Interfaces are contracts

### Interfaces allow us to specify that a particular class meets certain expectations that other classes can rely on.

### When a class implements an interface, it does not mean that class IS that interface.  For this reason interfaces that completely describe the functionality of a class are usually wrong.

### A class can implement multiple interfaces because each interface only talks about a particular contract that class is able to fulfill.
