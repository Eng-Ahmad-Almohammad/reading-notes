# Object-Oriented programming

### C# is an object-oriented programming language. The four basic principles of object-oriented programming are:

- Abstraction Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.
- Encapsulation Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.
- Inheritance Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.
- Polymorphism Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.
